# 📊 YT_ELT — End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline

YT_ELT is a **production-style end-to-end Data Engineering ELT project** that demonstrates how modern data pipelines are built, orchestrated, tested, and validated using industry-standard tools.

The pipeline extracts data from the **YouTube Data API**, loads it into **PostgreSQL**, transforms it using an **ELT approach**, enforces **data quality with Soda**, orchestrates workflows using **Apache Airflow**, and validates everything through **unit, integration, and DAG tests**, all running inside **Docker containers**.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Build real-world ELT pipelines using Python and SQL
- Orchestrate workflows using Apache Airflow
- Store and transform data in PostgreSQL
- Enforce data quality using Soda
- Write unit, integration, and DAG integrity tests
- Run everything in a containerized Docker environment
- Structure the project for CI/CD readiness
